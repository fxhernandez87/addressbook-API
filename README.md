The addressbook backend will be used by your users to perform the following tasks:

- Register new account
- Manage their contacts

## Technical details

This is a RESTful API delivered with expressJS

### Deployment

### Firebase & Heroku project naming convention

 #### Firebase project
 - [x] [strv-addressbook-hernandez-fra][firebase-url]

 #### Heroku project
 - [x] [strv-addressbook-hernandez-fra][heroku-url]

## Review process

### ðŸ”¥ Security

- [x] Private endpoint protected via token validation
- [x] User passwords encrypted with bcrypt package
  - I didn't know if the token created needed to be valid to use in firebase as a custom token, the production release contains a simple JWT token with HS256 algorithm signed with a SECRET phrase
  - But if you need it to be valid as a firebase custom token, the code is in this [commit](https://github.com/fxhernandez87/strv-addressbook-hernandez-francisco/commit/4d668c37dbbe5d86dd04a74970060e828eb1b9ef), where a public and private key was needed.

### ðŸ”¥ Testability

Fully tested with mocha, chai and sinonJS.
Also with test coverage

### Development and deployment
- Local:
  - To run this project locally we need to create a .env file using .env.example. 
  - Have mongodb running and thats it.
  - ***npm start***
- Deploy:
  - The API is connected with heroku CI and github. Every push to develop will create the API in a staging environment not before running the tests. The same happens with master branch, and will rebuild the app on production.
  - I use Git Flow as my work flow, so i try not to promote the staging environment to production, instead i create a release, a PR containing all the develop changes and review the app. Then i merge it to master.
